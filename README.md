This is a small little project to create artificial fits files of Jupiter and it's Moons, for the purposes of using in a mid-level Astronomy lab or lecture, being that the actual weather can be rather fickle. The objective of this code is create create realistic fake data: only nighttime images are produced, using the actual position of the body and it's moons on that particular time range. The relative intensities of each object and it's overall morphology are based on real data taken myself using a telescope similar to the artificial one described in the FITS header information. Ideally this data is supplimented or even replaced with real data where available.
